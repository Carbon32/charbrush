## About:

<img src = "https://i.imgur.com/wEhQmN5.png" width = 100% height = 100%>


This is a Pixel Editor (don't use this for a professional career, trust me), made in Python. The editor is able to handle some tasks including: 

* Managing different colors.
* Drawing/Erasing from the drawing board.
* Saving images and loading drawing projects.
* Managing interactive & animated Buttons.
* Scaling the board to your screen size.

This project is no longer in-development. But that doesn't mean it won't receive some updates. 

## Installation:

To be able to run Pixel Editor, you need to have Pygame & PySimpleGUI installed on your computer.

<b>NOTE:</b> Messing with directories may cause some unforeseen consequences...

   git clone https://github.com/Carbon32/py-pixel.git
   ```
2. Install all necessary libraries:
